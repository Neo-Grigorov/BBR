GAMEPLAY NOTES
Aaaaa
Story
-General
You are a droid, living in the [SWAMP] peripheral district of Nouveau Metro. Someone calls you from an unfamiliar number in [Arctic Cyburbia]. It’s your cousin. They’re calling from prison as they’ve been jailed for Bounce Ball Crimes. They deny the charges, but any resolution would be too late for them to compete in the next World circuit. Their spot needs filling and they want you to fill it. You’re only an amateur racer, but this could be your chance to prove yourself on the world stage, so you accept.
Racers
The Cousin: The star of SWAMPTOWN, they taught you everything about racing that the internet couldn’t. You two are on mostly good terms, but there’s a distance between you that’s only grown since the moved to ARCTIC CITY. An all-around amazing racer, though a little (very) cocky.
SWAMP WITCH: Old. Runs the tutorial track and helps get you used to racing again. She somehow made a racer out of wood.
VOID: Self-proclaimed rival to YOUR COUSIN, with an unhealthy obsession with beating them in the world series. They project some of this rivalry on to you. Extremely aggressive on the track, but much more reserved and polite everywhere else. Has kind of a stoic, edgy persona that softens as they get more familiar.
Lemon: The first racer you meet in NOUVEAU METRO. Sweet and kind, but competitive to a fault. Don’t let her personality fool you, as LEMON is ruthless on the track. She tries to be as self-sufficient as possible, and built her own unorthodox racer that has bumps on the sides of its bubble that make it resemble a lemon.
Sharky: 
Spitbug: Shy, avoids other racers on the track.
Lunarcore:
Graffiti Wizard:
Fishtank:
virus: racer looks like a virus
Lightstreak: Cowboy
MeltyChrome:
Minimalist:
Bandana:
Grease Ape:
Hotrod:
Coppa Smoke: “My wife left me... Racing dulls the pain.”
Neon Mask: They’re really depressed, but coping well.
BONUS – Spherical Visitor: An alien whose spherical shape, with a dense core and cushioned, gaseous outer shell makes them perfectly suited for BOUNCE BALL RACING.
